## 🔗 Demo

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` file in your browser
3. Or run a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)

## 📱 Responsiveness

The page was designed with responsiveness in mind using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities and adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop** (lg: 1024px+) - Full layout with large typography using `lg:` prefixes
- **Tablet** (md: 768px - 1023px) - Adjusted spacing and font sizes using `md:` prefixes
- **Mobile Large** (sm: 640px - 767px) - Stacked layout with optimized content using `sm:` prefixes
- **Mobile Small** (default: <640px) - Compact design for small screens with base classes

Tailwind's responsive design follows a mobile-first approach where base classes apply to all screen sizes and larger breakpoints override when needed.

## 🎨 Color Scheme

- **Background**: Black (`bg-black`)
- **Text**: White (`text-white`)
- **Title Gradient**: From #FF1CF7 to #00F0FF (`bg-gradient-to-r from-[#FF1CF7] to-[#00F0FF]`)
- **Buttons**: Blue and purple gradients using Tailwind gradient utilities

## ⚡ Tailwind CSS Features Used

- **Utility Classes** - Complete styling using utility-first approach
- **Responsive Design** - `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` breakpoint prefixes
- **Custom Colors** - Using arbitrary values with `[]` notation for brand colors
- **Flexbox & Grid** - Modern layout with `flex`, `grid`, and related utilities
- **Typography** - Custom font families and responsive text sizing
- **Gradients** - Text and background gradients for visual appeal
- **Hover Effects** - Interactive states with `hover:` prefix
- **Spacing** - Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale

## 🛠️ Design Process

1. **Figma Design** - Created the initial design concept
