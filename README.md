1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` file in your browser
3. Or run a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)

### 📱 Mobile Menu Functionality

The mobile menu includes:

- **Hamburger Icon** - Material Symbols "menu" icon that toggles navigation
- **Responsive Toggle** - Shows/hides navigation and social links on mobile
- **Dynamic Layout** - Changes header from horizontal to vertical layout
- **JavaScript Control** - Manages visibility and layout classes dynamically

## 📱 Responsiveness

The page was designed with responsiveness in mind using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities and adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop** (lg: 1024px+) - Full layout with large typography using `lg:` prefixes
- **Tablet** (md: 768px - 1023px) - Adjusted spacing and font sizes using `md:` prefixes
- **Mobile Large** (sm: 640px - 767px) - Stacked layout with optimized content using `sm:` prefixes
- **Mobile Small** (default: <640px) - Compact design for small screens with base classes

Tailwind's responsive design follows a mobile-first approach where base classes apply to all screen sizes and larger breakpoints override when needed.

- **Background**: Black (`bg-black`)
- **Text**: White (`text-white`)
- **Title Gradient**: From #FF1CF7 to #00F0FF (`bg-gradient-to-r from-[#FF1CF7] to-[#00F0FF]`)
- **Buttons**: Blue and purple gradients using Tailwind gradient utilities
